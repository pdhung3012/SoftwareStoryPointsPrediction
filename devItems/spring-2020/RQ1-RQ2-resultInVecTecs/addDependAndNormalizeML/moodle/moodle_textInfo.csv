Paypal call the script and pass various token regard the transaction . the ipn script : 1 ) open a handle for the paypal connection 2 ) evaluate the receive token and validate they 3 ) enrol a student accordingly 4 ) notify the student   instructor & admin via a call to message_send ( ) 5 ) close the connection from paypal various people have be report that they paypal enrolment work fine for a while   but they start get these IPN failure warning message from Paypal . in they IPN history in Paypal   they see a list of fail transaction where the server ( moodle ) response be a 404 . what be happen for these people   be the 4th step above be fail . the ipn script die as a product of message_send ( ) fail and the PHP server process would seem to time out and cause the web server to return a 404 to paypal . since step 3 have be complete   end user of moodle be get what they need from the plugin . however Paypal doesn t tolerate the 404 response for long and automatically disable IPN message after a while - cause paypal enrolment to fail entirely . the solution I be propose be really simple . I have modify ipn.php to use a wrapper function for message_send that put the call in try - catch block . this insulate the execution of ipn.php from whatever message_send failure ruin the whole experience . I believe resolve the issue in message_send be another matter ( and may merely be a misconfiguration thing - though myself and other do have system that send we email successfully   guess those situation aren t depend on the same function ) . I have attach my modify version of ipn.php below . I hope it be immediately merge in to the main development branch as this be probably affect even more people than have be complain about it . this issue have be observe by I personally across a wide range of 2.x moodle installation .

Moodle need a way to input both type of name   and for both the individual and the administrator ( and perhaps at the course level ) to determine which name appear in the various Moodle context . * a ideal configuration * I propose three additional field : * surnamephon givenphon alternatename * for standard english and european usage   these would be ignore   but for japanese   chinese   korean and perhaps other write system such as Thai   the various indian language and arabic . possible entry would look like this : | | | | lastname | | firstname | | lastphon | | firstphon | | alternate | | | Japanese | 佐藤 | 宏 | サトウ | ヒロシ | Satou Hiroshi | | korean | 李 | 奎報 | 이 | 규보 | Yi Gyubo | | Chinese | 陳 | 美和 | ㄔㄣ | ㄇㄟㄏㄨㄚ | Chen MeiHua | the site administrator would select how the $ fullname variable would appear . for japanese   for example   the administrator might select lastname + firstname + alternate so that the student name would appear in Kanji   but with the romanization of it follow the Kanji . this would allow everyone to know how the name should be pronounce . ( even japanese need this since there be alternate pronunciation for Kanji . 神部 for example   could be read as Kamibe or Kambe depend on the preference of the user s family . ) any combination of the above could also be select as the default for user name that appear in various table . if the select field for table be one of the asian phonetic field   then rather than the standard alphabet display for filter the list by first name and last name   a similar selection display would appear for the select alphabetic system . for chinese   a selection would also need to be make for the phonetic system to use . Taiwan use the BoPoMoFo ( Zhuyin ) system   while mainland China use the Pinyin system . * Student ID Display * for many asian language   another problem not encounter so much in the West be people with identical name . this   plus the fact that some of the language ( namely japanese and chinese ) have no convenient method for order name in chinese character   mean that most school rely on the student id for order and identify student rather than ( or in addition to ) they name . thus   there should also be a option in the site set - up select the StudentID field to be display to the left of name on various listing such as the grade book   assignment evaluation   etc . * complexity & coding time : * this problem be quite complex since it involve modify core code in perhaps 50 - 100 file that do database I o   table display   preference selection   etc . and would need to be do in close coordination with Moodle Headquarters . * who would benefit from this improvement ? : * probably every institution in Asia that have staff who do not read the local language need to be able to display name in both the local language and roman letter . various   rather unsatisfactory ad hoc solution be currently use but a permanent   more elegant solution be urgently need .,NN .

I have do some testing and find that it be possible to get ~ 100x performance boost by bundle multiple insert into one query use the syntax : { { INSERT INTO table ( field1   field2   field3 ) value ( a1   a2   a3 )   ( b1   b2   b3 )   ( c1   c2   c3 )   ... } } I have write a generic function to do bulk insert : { quote } Insert multiple record into a table use batch insert syntax for speed } } @ param string $ table the database table to be insert into @ param iterator $ iterator a iterable object ( such as moodle_recordset or array ) contain object to be insert into $ table @ return true @ throw dml_exception if error public function insert_records_via_batch ( $ table   $ iterator ) { } { quote } the function build the query by add record from the iterator until it reach either the maximum query length or maximum record count ( both predefined constant )   then it do a insert and start build a fresh query . by accept a iterator you can pass in a whole array   or a recordset ( to avoid store all the datum to be insert in memory ) . although it work in simple case I be find that there be quite a few subtlety in the depths of dmllib and to make it work with all field type and database I think some core dml change might be need .

I do a lot of unsuccessful troubleshooting   which I have not report -- here s where we be at now   hopefully it be useful to someone . please note that the change I detail below be not a fix   they be do for troubleshooting   use they in production introduce other problem : trace the backup process we find the problem would always occur in the backup_structure_dbops.class.php file in the function move_annotations_to_final ( $ backupid   $ itemname ) within the $ db - > set_field ( backup_ids_temp   itemname   $ itemname . final   array ( id = > $ annotation - > id ) ) ; call . add trace here show it tick along fine but then just stop . multiple attempt to backup the same course ( after wait for cron to clear out temp stuff ) end up fail at the same point . trace deeper into the set_field function   it call the sqlsrv do_query   to troubleshoot   I add a query timeout as follow ( none be specify originally ) in sqlsrv_native_moodle_database function do_query $ result = sqlsrv_query ( $ this - > sqlsrv   $ sql   array ( )   array ( querytimeout = > 10 ) ) ; the backup now return with error debug info : sqlstate : hyt00 < br > Error Code : 0 < br > message : [ Microsoft ] [ sql server native client 10.0 ] query timeout expire < br > update # mdl_backup_ids_temp set itemname = n filefinal where id = 1366 [ array ( 0 = > filefinal   1 = > 1366   ) ] stack trace : • line 397 of \ lib \ dml \ moodle_database.php : dml_write_exception throw • line 252 of \ lib \ dml \ sqlsrv_native_moodle_database.php : call to moodle_database - > query_end ( ) • line 370 of \ lib \ dml \ sqlsrv_native_moodle_database.php : call to sqlsrv_native_moodle_database - > query_end ( ) • line 1098 of \ lib \ dml \ sqlsrv_native_moodle_database.php : call to sqlsrv_native_moodle_database - > do_query ( ) • line 1475 of \ lib \ dml \ moodle_database.php : call to sqlsrv_native_moodle_database - > set_field_select ( ) • line 146 of \ backup \ util \ dbop \ backup_structure_dbops.class.php : call to moodle_database - > set_field ( ) • line 1338 of \ backup \ moodle2 \ backup_stepslib.php : call to backup_structure_dbops : : move_annotations_to_final ( ) • line 34 of \ backup \ util \ plan \ backup_execution_step.class.php : call to move_info ref_annotations_to_final - > define_execution ( ) • line 153 of \ backup \ util \ plan \ base_task.class.php : call to backup_execution_step - > execute ( ) • line 148 of \ backup \ util \ plan \ base_plan.class.php : call to base_task - > execute ( ) • line 105 of \ backup \ util \ plan \ backup_plan.class.php : call to base_plan - > execute ( ) • line 296 of \ backup \ controller \ backup_controller.class.php : call to backup_plan - > execute ( ) • line 111 of \ backup \ util \ ui \ backup_ui.class.php : call to backup_controller - > execute_plan ( ) • line 89 of \ backup \ backup.php : call to backup_ui - > execute ( ) vary the timeout have no effect ; it fail at the same place   just would take longer ... so add the timeout here get the backup process to fail after the timeout ( rather than wait for a fastcgi timeout ) . it look like mssql just not respond . I want to see what be happen with the table   which be hard for mssql and temp table   since they be session base . I don t have access to the moodle db session temp table from my db admin tool . to get around this   I modify \ backup \ util \ dbop \ backup_controller_dbops_class.php ( around line 141 & 150 )   so that a real table be create delete   instead of use MSSQLs session base temp table ( just remove _ temp _ in the call to dbman   ie $ dbman - > create_temp_table ( $ xmldb_table ) ; become $ dbman - > create_table ( $ xmldb_table ) ; and around 150 $ dbman - > drop_temp_table ( $ table ) ; become $ dbman - > drop_table ( $ table ) ; there be a similar fix neccessary in \ backup \ util \ dbop \ restore_controller_dbops_class.php   line 109   with this change   the backup and restore work ok . my hypothesis be that at some point during the long backup   another connection get make to mssql ; since temp table be associate with connection   the link to the original temp table get lose and the datum isn t available . of course this doesn t explain why the sqlsrv call ust time out rather than return a error . we have actually be use the system with this little change   but it be not really satisfactory -- the problem   of course   be that only one backup restore can be run on the system at any one time because there be just the one temp table ; and multiple backup just conflict   require the temp table we create to be drop . some related post http moodle.org mod forum discuss.php ? d = 177822 ( I post this early ) possibly related http tracker.moodle.org browse mdl - 28162 other commenter on this issue be on MSSQL,PRP VBD DT NN WRB PRP$ VBN NNS JJ NN VBG RB : PRP LS VB JJ JJ NN IN .

683,add a mathjax filter,VB DT NN NN,ROOT det compound obj,a demo mathjax filter be add to the prototype.moodle.net text editor demo . this be a pretty good implementation   but there be 2 problem with it . 1 the full mathjax library be hundred of megabyte ( font ) - it be just too big to include the whole thing in Moodle . so - some font be strip etc to keep the size of that one down - and it be still over 30 mb . a alternative be to use the CDN mathjax library by default - and provide a method to download and install the full version into moodledata for people who require it ( firewall proxy etc ) . 2 it do thing properly ( moodley ) by wrap the mathjax library a yui module and include it from the footer . this mean that the loading of mathjax do not block the rest of the page display . the downside be that the alternative method of install mathjax be to link to it in additionalhtmlhead . this include mathjax earlier   so the equation on the page be render earlier - and some people prefer that option . maybe there be a alternative way of include it that will load it earlier . 3 however it be load link etc . in the forum sample I have see   it be link to from the head with almost a default configuration . this be a xss risk - the tex allow some token which can produce e.g . javascript after render .

Options Data suggest that the most widely use _ primary _ reader by far be * Jaws * [ 1 ] though it be usage have see rapid decline over the past few year . Jaws be follow in popularity by Windows - eye   and Apple s voiceover . ChromeVox be the only screen reader we have come across to support the same browser across multiple operating system which may also be a important consideration for some user . at present its market share be low ( 0.2 % [ 1 ] ) but it be new to the arena - from what I can tell it be only release in February 2012 [ 2 ] with the survey take place in May 2012 . NVDA   which come in at fourth place in the webaim survey be also a interesting option as it be the highest rank free solution for Windows   though it be only compatible with Windows and the Firefox + IE browser . h4 . recommendation to offer the most widespread selection it make sense to choose from the follow subset of screen reader . I have not   at this stage   comment on the ease of development for each screen reader at present   or it be comparative support for various accessiblity functionality . h5 . Jaws Pros : * high market penetration con : * cost to user * Windows only * internet explorer only h5 . NVDA Pros : * Free * mid-level market penetration con : * Windows only * Firefox and Internet Explorer only h5 .

Developers should not write component instead they should be re-use the available element and component . * overriding a render to change how a element must be both easy and robust * re-use be key as per the above point . however we need to achieve this in such a way that we don t introduce magic and keep thing simple to understand and override . we have to be able to deal with state and attribute requirement of the element in relation to its parent component and do it in such as way that the state be own by the component and attribute be owner by the render method . and keep it all understandable .,DT VBZ DT JJ NN IN DT NN HYPH RB DT NNS VBP JJ CC WP PRP VBP RB PRP VBP TO VB IN CC VB IN .

( this would be 3 extra column on grade_grade ) older - more complicated description : at the moment   exclude and empty grade not be calculate in the final grade   be not enable with sum of grade ( the basis of natural weight ) . also currently we have not introduce code to handle display hidden grade in the report . to do : # update report to not consider empty grade . this work will be partially solve by mdl - 47078 . # update report to exclude hidden grade item . please note that hidden grade item be item hide to all student and doesn t cover conditional access to activity . example : ( please note that this be the desire outcome ) * exclude empty grade * student 1 | | Grade item | | Grade | | percent | | | assign 1 | 10 20 | 50 % | | assign 2 | 10 40 | 5 % | | assign 3 | - 80 | - | | total | 20 60 | 33.33 % | student 2 | | Grade item | | Grade | | percent | | | assign 1 | - 20 | - | | assign 2 | - 40 | - | | assign 3 | 20 80 | 25 % | | total | 20 80 | 25.00 % | student 1 20 ( 33.00 % ) student 2 20 ( 25.00 % ) * exclude hidden grade item * student 1 | | Grade item | | Grade | | percent | | | assign 1 | 10 20 | 50 % | | assign 2 - hide | - 40 | - | | assign 3 | 40 80 | 50 % | | total | 50 100 | 50.00 % | student 2 | | Grade item | | Grade | | percent | | | assign 1 | 15 20 | 75 % | | assign 2 - hide | - 40 | - | | assign 3 | 20 80 | 25 % | | total | 35 100 | 35.00 % | student 1 20 ( 50.00 % ) student 2 20 ( 35.00 % ) * additional technical information : * http tracker.moodle.org browse mdl - 46139 introduce a field   grade_grade : : aggregationweight that may be helpful . currently   grade_category : : auto_update_weights ( ) adjust grade_item weight but do this trickle down to grade_grades ? if a individual student can not see a activity be zero grade_grade : : aggregationweight and recalculate the weight in that category for that student sufficient ? this code may want to live in get_hiding_affected ( ) in grade_grade.php .,JJ NN IN DT NN : VB JJ NN JJ IN VBN NNS -LRB- CC VBN IN VB JJ NNS , CC RB VBN NNS -RRB- .
