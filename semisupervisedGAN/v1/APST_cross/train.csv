1,Identify test data and camera,To test processCcd we need to identify a set of data to process (possibly mocked).  This implies that there will also need to be a minimal camera to go with the minimal data.  This task is to identify the minimal data and find a location for it.
1,Implement designed tests for processCcd,Implement the designed tests with the installed data.
1,Generate use case,We should first sit down with a Camera team rep (Jim C. maybe) to define the tool they need.  How dynamic are the data?  What is the layout of the data?  We should also get some example test data to work with.
1,Sync test data headers with standards,The headers will need to be vetted against known FITS standards.  The headers should be valid and should not contain any non-standard keywords.  There should also be a census of FITS standards that may be used for defining sensor layout.
2,Implement a tool to generate a Camera from FITS images,Implement the tool to generate the camera object.  It should be a command line tool that will take a path to a file.  It should have an option to persist the generated camera.  It should also have the ability to plot the camera.
1,Verify use of the tool with the camera team,We will need to run the tool in the camera team's system to make sure the interfaces are as they expected.  It will also help to make sure that the tool addresses all of the cases.
1,Design the API,"The API will have to be able to accommodate data we know about, so will need to deal with reasonable missing data.  It should also not preclude extension.  This will need to be RFC'd since it is an API change."
