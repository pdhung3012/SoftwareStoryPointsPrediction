1,Improve management of qserv-run-dir in start/stop scripts.,qserv-start.sh by default tries again to use /usr/local/home/salnikov/qserv-run/2014_05.0 directory. There may be a confusion if we have multiple run directories. Would it be better to install qserv start/stop scripts into run directory itself so that the
4,Add Doxygen documentation on rebuilds,Master-branch doxygen documentation should be rebuild on every full master build.
1,Clearer and shorter output for qserv-configure.py,qserv-configure.py produces a lot of output which could be confusing if people try to look at it and understand it. It may be better to reduce it to something that just indicates that each step is completed successfully.
1,Use aliases to clean up table version transition,"The addition of schema aliases on DM-417 should allow us to clean up some of the transitional code added on DM-545, as we can now alias new versions of fields to the old ones and vice versa."
1,measAlg.interpolateOverDefects doesn't accept a python list of Defects,The python binding of interpolateOverDefects should accept a python list of Defects as well as a swig-wrapped std::vector<Defect>; it doesn't (try using a python list in test818 in meas_algorithms/tests/Interp.py)  
1,Include aliases in Schema introspection,Schema stringification and iteration should include aliases somehow.  Likewise the extract() Python methods.

1,add base class for measurement tasks,"We should consider adding a base class for measurement tasks (SingleFrameMeasurementTask, ForcedMeasuremedTask) that includes the callMeasure methods.  I'm hoping this will help cleanup callMeasure and improve code reuse."
1,Add FunctorKey to replace Coord compound keys,"Unlike previous FunctorKey replacements, Coord compound Keys are used in the minimal schema for SimpleTable and SourceTable, which makes removing them problematic."
1,allow partial measurement results to be set when error flag is set,We need to be able to return values at the same time that an error flag is set.  The easiest way to do this is to have Algorithms take a Result object as an output argument rather than return it.  We'll revisit this design later. 
1,.my.cnf in user HOME directory breaks setup script,Presence of {{.my.cnf}} file in the user HOME directory crashes {{qserv-configure.py}} script if parameters in {{.my.cnf}} conflict with parameters in {{qserv.conf}}.  How to reproduce: * create .my.cnf file in the home directory: {code} [client] user    
1,add query involving a blob to the integration tests,We need to add a query (or more?) to the qserv_testdata that involve blobs. Blobs are interesting because they might break some parts of the qserv if we failed to escape things properly etc.

1,Make NoiseReplacer a context manager,"I think the API for NoiseReplacer could be made more idiomatic (and possibly safer) by turning it into a ""context manager"" (i.e. so it can be used with the ""with"" statement)."
3,Adapt integration test to multi-node setup v1,Following DM-595 we can start qserv in multi-node configuration. Next step is to be able to run integration tests in that setup. This needs a bit of understanding how to distribute chunks between all workers in a cluster and how to load data in remote mys
1,rename config file(s) in Qserv,"Rename local.qserv.cnf to qserv-czar.cnf. It is quite likely there are some other config files that would make sense to rename. If you see some candidates, let's discussion on qserv-l and do the renames."

1,Detailed documentation for GaussianCentroid,"We need more detailed documentation for the GaussianCentroid algorithm, in terms of how it actually computes the centroid.  We (Jim and Perry) have done what we can, but we need help from whoever actually wrote it (RHL, we think) to provide the rest.  In "

4,Create utilities to allow camera testing team to use CameraGeom,"The camera team can use the CameraGeom classes to reduce lab data for testing purposes.  Since the camera is relatively flexible, a good way of doing this is to create a camera at runtime from the header keys in the files to be reduced.    JK: In PMCS thi"
4,Make the API for ISR explicit,The run method of the IsrTask currently takes a dataRef which has getters for calibration products.  This makes the task hard to re-use because one needs a butler and because the interface is opaque.  This task will make the IsrTask API more transparent. 
4,Re-write astrometry task to remove dependency on astrometry.net,The astrometry task currently depends as astrometry.net as the only possible algorithmic back end.  This also has created a dependency on the astrometry.net file format.    This task will remove the dependency on astrometry.net file format and will implem

3,Storage Usage Report Service,Provide a way to generate a report with at least the following information:   - Number of files for each space - Total size of files stored in each space - Average file size for each space - File types (mimetypes) represented in each space  - Total number
4,Failed to copy all files when running a large Duplicate-on-Demand service,A small percentage of files are not copied during the execution of a large Duplicate on Demand service execution.  This can result in either a missing file or a zero length file in the target space.  This has bug has been demonstrated repeatedly both betw
