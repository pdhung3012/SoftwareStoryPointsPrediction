2,Auto update version check reports new version when version strings are identical,"Under File > Settings > IDE Settings: Clover > Auto Update, when you press ""Check now"" a window pops up saying:    ""New version available: 3.1.10.v20130108000000, you have 3.1.10.v20130108000000  Would you like to upgrade?""    "
2,Embed clover profile array in instrumented classes,"Enhance existing instrumentation and embed an array of CloverProfile in instrumented sources/classes, pass this array to Clover.getRecorder().    Java: source based instrumentation  RecorderInstrEmitter + Clover.getRecorder()     - add static field for _C"
2,Use GrowableBitSet for PerTestRecorder.One,"In PerTestRecorder.One - wrap 'coverage' and coverageShortcut into a helper class (x)    set() method - if index is out of bounds then it shall resize 'coverage' BitSet and 'coverageShortcut' array (/)    refactor PerTestRecorder.Any, None, One, Many to t"
2,Split clover-core into clover-runtime + clover-core,1) Use class dependency analyzer. Check for classes loaded via reflections too!!! (/) _class dependency analyzer was also used to strip third party libraries from unused classes_    2) Move runtime classes to clover-runtime module. (/)    3) -Rename packa
2,Create <clover-embed-runtime> task,"Create Ant task:  {noformat}  <clover-embed-runtime targetFile=""jar/war/ear file""/>  {noformat}  which will put all Clover's runtime classes into targetFile.     Unzip all com_cenqua_clover.* and com.atlassian.clover.runtime.* classes from clover.jar arch"
2,Create clover2:embed-runtime-jar goal,Create MOJO for:    {noformat}  clover2:embed-runtime-jar  {noformat}    which will read the <targetJar> property and do the same what Ant task does.    Difference: we might use maven-assembly-plugin and download clover-runtime artifact for this.
2,Maven extracts clover-runtime into target/classes or target/classes-clover,Automatic integration for unknown plug-ins: extract clover-runtime artifact into current build folder (target/classes for clover2:setup and target/classes-clover for clover2:instrument). Thanks to this these runtime classes might be automatically picked u
2,Maven: intercept maven-jar-plugin and add clover-runtime,"Check if it would be possible to define some Maven property for maven-jar-plugin which would allow to define directory or list of files to be added to the archive. If yes, then extract clover-runtime into e.g. target/clover/runtime (note: it shall not int"

2,Maven: intercept maven-war-plugin and add clover-runtime,The same as CLOV-1242 but for maven-war-plugin
2,Maven: intercept maven-cargo-plugin and add clover-runtime dependency,The maven-cargo-plugin is the most popular plugin for running in-container tests. Add <dependency> for clover-runtime there. Add configuration option to have a possibility to disable this.
2,Eclipse: extract clover-runtime classes into build directory,Extract clover-runtime.jar into project's build folder so that other packaging tools could automatically pick these classes. Add pre-build or post-clean event handler to make sure that these classes will be still present after rebuild. Add some option in 
2,IDEA: extract clover-runtime classes into build directories,IDEA integration - put these classes into:   * out/production and    * out/test.     Add option in File > Settings > Project Settings or File > Settings > IDE Settings for this.
2,Grails: extract clover-runtime into build directory,Usually it's here:    <home>\.grails\X.Y.Z\projects\<project_name>\classes
2,Prepare integration tests for GrowableCoverageRecorder,Integration tests like:     * GrowableCoverageRecorder on a large code base     * GrowableCoverageRecorder with different strategies     ** PerTestRecorder.One / Many / None     ** ThreadVisibilityStrategy.SingleThreaded / Volatile / Synchronized    => es

2,Some of per-test recording strategies do not work for multi-threaded applications,*Introduction*    We've got five per-test recording strategies:    * Diffing - clover.pertest.coverage=diff  * Null - clover.pertest.coverage=off  * SingleThreaded  - clover.pertest.coverage=<empty> and clover.pertestcoverage.threading=<empty> - DEFAULT P
2,Add Ant dependendency to com.cenqua.clover:clover maven artifact,"Problem occurs in Gradle framework. When developer declares dependency to Clover artefact and tries to instrument project with Clover, it fails with a not-very-informative error:    {noformat}  [clover-setup] Detected groovyc compiler org.codehaus.groovy."
2,Add clover.coverageRecorder field for Clover-for-Grails plugin,*A follow-up of CLOV-1189:*    Support the coverageRecorder natively in the plugin config. It would be nice to go back to using the simpler configuration instead of the setuptask/reporttask closures. Like:    {noformat}  clover {    coverageRecorder: 'SHA
2,Upgrade third party libraries used by Clover,"Upgrade third party libraries to their latest versions:   * jebrains annotations 13.0 (/)   * ASM 5.0  (/) we're using ASM 3.0, 4.1 and 5.0 actually (for different purposes)   * commons-codec 1.9 (/)   * commons-collections 3.2.1 (/)   * commons-lang 2.6 "
2,Reduce friction in tutorial,"Make Clover evaluation easier by simplifying the tutorial. The build.xml shall contain full Clover set-up so that just typing ""ant"" shall produce all reports. So swap build.xml <-> build_completed.xml, fix ""test"" target name, add default=""clover.all"" etc."
2,IDEA Darcula theme ignores <table border=0>,"Clover's ""About"" dialog looks ugly when the ""Darcula"" theme is selected in IDEA 12. Despite having <table border=""0""> in JEditorPane(""text/html""), it shows table with a border. Example:    !clover_about_idea12_themes.png!"
2,Race condition in IDEA during full rebuild and test execution,"Clover-for-IDEA. Race condition during database cleanup and running unit tests at the same time.     Steps to reproduce;    1.

2,as a developer I'd like to track build events in IDEA12 external build,"*Prepare empty plugin for external build.*    analyze external build API, prepare a simple plugin which will log compilation progress (module name, file name being compiled) and send notifications about it to IDE; it should also notify about ""compilation "
2,Check how parallel instrumentation can be handled,"External build supports parallel compilation. Modules are built in parallel, while files in a single module are compiled sequentially.     Clover expects that at least a single file is instrumented sequentially (the FileInto getCoverageMask which returns "
2,Test IDEA IDE - build server interaction,Exploratory tests in user interface.
2,Reduce coverage requirements for groovy safe operator,Currently any usage of the groovy safe operator requires that that reference be tested with a null and non-null value.  This adds significant overhead in the case where multiple calls are chained together with the safe operator.  It would be more useful a
2,Error when trying to Check for an Update,I just recently upgraded from IntelliJ IDEA 10.5.4 to 12.1.1 and now 12.1.2.  I think my last update to Clover was BEFORE I updated IDEA versions.
2,Support custom metrics in PDF report,Currently the PDF report does not handle <columns> element so it's not possible to have a custom set of metrics in the summary. 
2,PDF report with class-level and method-level summary,The PDF report contains package-level coverage table. Add an option for:   * <clover-report> Ant task   * clover2:clover mojo   * 'generate report' button in Eclipse    * 'generate report' button in IDEA    which would allow user to select report detail l

2,Warn if directory selected on Test Classes tab is disabled on Source Files tab,"On the ""Project Properties > Clover > Source Files"" tab user can select which source folders shall be instrumented by Clover. By de-selecting the checkbox, the whole source root becomes excluded from instrumentation:    !source_files.png!    On the ""Test "
2,Implicit return in Groovy switch statement is instrumented incorrectly,"*Problem:*    Consider the following code:    {code:java}  def create(boolean b) {          switch (b) {              case true:                  new Integer(10)                  break              case false:                  new String(""abc"")           "
2,Added LICENSES.html file to Clover artfiacts,Add the LICENSES.html file containing a table with:   * name of third party library   * link to home page (download sources / binaries)   * link to the license file    into the following artifacts:   * Clover-for-Ant ZIP   * Clover-for-Eclipse update site
2,Set up a Bamboo build for JDK1.8,"run all clover tests, including tests of java8 syntax on JDK1.8 on Bamboo"
2,Add new grammar rules for java8 syntax,"just to correctly parse new syntax, do not add clover instrumentation to these new code constructs    something like:    lambda :      ( lambdaNoArgs | lambdaImplicitTypesArgs | lambdaExplicitTypesArgs )     '->'     ( lambdaExpressionLikeStatement | lamb"
2,Add Spock test name patterns in default test detector ,Clover's default test detector should properly recognize Spock-framework test classes and which methods are test ones and which are helper ones. We shall not see stuff like this in the test summary:    {noformat}  Tests 	Started 	Status 	Time (secs) 	Mess
2,Ensure that reports show the test name and not the method name,"Make sure that HTML, XML, PDF, JSON reports will display the test name (like ""my test name"" taken from def) rather than the actual name of test method (like $spock_feature). "
2,as a developer I don't need to run Clover on JDK1.5 anymore,*Idea:*    Sun Java 1.5 has:   * end of public updates - Oct 2009   * end of Premier Support - May 2011   * end of Extended Support - May 2015   * see http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/eol-135779.html    IBM Java 1.5:   * its End Of Servcie (EOS) wil
2,Extend API for loading and manipulate coverage files ,Clover 3.2.0 published new interfaces describing a database model (com.atlassian.clover.api.registry). We need to reveal more Clover stuff via API in order to make it more usable by other developers.    For example:   * loading database and coverage files
2,Change signature of getXyz() methods in HasXyz interfaces,"Current signatures have <? extends X>, for example:    {code:java}  List<? extends MethodInfo> getMethods()  {code}    This works fine for Clover's internal data structures (as there are subclasses), but it's not usable by developers using this API. It sh"
2,Create interfaces and factory methods for loading Clover database,"*Problem:*    Database entities are already in c.a.c.api.registry package.     However, in order to load the database you have to call an inner class, for example:    {code:java}  import com.atlassian.clover.CloverDatabase;      // XXX internal class  imp"
2,Create interfaces and some template class for handling instrumentation sessions,"*Problem:*    In order to update content of a database and store new instrumentation session a number of internal classes must be used, e.g.:    {code:java}  import com.atlassian.clover.context.ContextSet;  import com.atlassian.clover.registry.Clover2Regi"
2,Create API for handling coverage recording files,"*Problem:*    Currently there's no API which would allow to create a global recording or a per-test recording file.

2,Create API for handling optimization snapshot,*See:*   * [Hacking Clover / Updating optimization snapshot file|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/CLOVER/Updating+optimization+snapshot+file]   * [src/it/optmized/snapshot-hacking|https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/maven-clover2-plugin]    *Problem:*
2,Perform Scala spike,"This task is time-boxed to 5 days. Take a look at:  * our Scala prototype  * SCCT  * Scoverage  to learn how instrumentation could be implemented. Expected outcome:  * knowledge how scalac works (compilation phases, AST structure, plugging into it)  * det"
2,Java 1.8 Exceptions not being propagated correctly,I have the following test stub (src/main/java)    {code:java}  public final class TestStub {      TestStub() {          throw new IllegalArgumentException();      }        public static void getHandler() {          new HashMap<>().computeIfAbsent(String.c
2,Java 1.8 compilation fails when lambda is passed to a generic argument,The following piece of code fails to be instrumented  {code:java}  public class Fails<N> {        public final <S extends N> Iterable<S> depthFirstTraversal(Class<S> type) {          return (Iterable<S>) depthFirstTraversal(e -> type.isInstance(e));      
2,Clover fails to instrument generic type with a constructor reference,This works fine:    {code:java}  myLambda = ArrayList::new;   // javac error since JDK8 b114  myLambda = ArrayList::<String>new;  {code}    But the following:    {code:java}  myLambda = ArrayList<String>::new;  myLambda = ArrayList<String>::<String>new;  
2,As a developer I'd like to see JUnit Parameterized tests in the report,Similarly to the Spock framework (CLOV-1256) I'd like to see runtime test names from the JUnit4 parameterized tests. Example:    {code:java}  import org.junit.*;  import org.junit.runner.*;  import org.junit.runners.*;  import java.util.*;    import stati
2,change contributing tests table to TablesSortable etc,"Change a table with contributing tests:  !contributing_tests.png!    To do:   * table into TableSortable   * ""Show/hide tests"" label into expander   * ""Select all/deselect all"" labels into single master toggle   * remember about highlighting of lines of c"
2,JDK8 sources fail to compile when instrumented by Clover,"See the attached comparison of original and instrumented code:    [^unicode_decoding_error.png]    A problem is as follows:   * Clover has a UnicodeDecodingReader class which translates 6-letter character sequences ""\uNNNN"" into a single UTF16 character  "
2,Integration tests are not being instrumented in Grails 2.3,Clover does not instrument integration tests in Grails 2.3.     Caused by:   * new GrailsIntegrationTestCompiler wrapper introduced in Grails 2.3.0 is not being recognized by Clover as a Groovy compiler   * GrailsTestRunner calls Groovy compiler internall
2,Create an API for plugging custom I/O handler,"Currently Clover uses a standard Java IO/NIO libraries to read from and write to: a coverage database, coverage recording files (global and per-test), test optimization snapshots.     This is not sufficient when user want to run an application on a custom"
2,Add possibility to configure <profiles> in Eclipse and IDEA IDEs,"The <clover-setup> and <clover-instr> tasks allow to define <profiles> section, where we can select coverage recorder type etc. There's no possibility to configure it in Clover-for-Eclipse and Clover-for-IDEA plugins."
2,Test spock under gradle,"We don't support Gradle. However, it's worth checking how our Spock works (or not :-) ) with open-source gradle clover plugins available.    To do:    * prepare a sample app with a build.gradle script   * integrate Clover into it using the https://github."
2,Several tests fail with Cannot cast object ... to class 'com_cenqua_clover.CoverageRecorder',See here for a travis build exhibiting this problem:    https://travis-ci.org/thehyve/transmart-core-db/jobs/21220075    19 tests there fail because of this problem. The culprit seems to be this line: https://github.com/thehyve/transmart-core-db/blob/5e8f
2,Rename com.cenqua to com.atlassian,"Rename all references to ""Cenqua"" to ""Atlassian"". It affects:   * java packages - com.cenqua.* and com_cenqua_clover (/)   * Clover-for-Eclipse plugins and features (/)   * com.cenqua.clover:clover artifact (clover core) (/)    Optional:    Rename also Cl"

Add ""automatic"" option (up "
2,replace a vertical navigation component by a sidebar,Instead of the aui-vertical-nav use the aui-sidebar component. 
2,as a developer I'd like to have nanosecond precision for test duration,In reports lots of tests have duration = 0. This is because unit tests are fast and the System.currentTimeMillis() is used to record start and end time of a test. Which is not precise by design.    We could increase precision to nanoseconds using System.n

1,Propose and document a recipe to build Qserv in eups,In-place build is available and documented.
2,Identify test data and camera,To test processCcd we need to identify a set of data to process (possibly mocked).  This implies that there will also need to be a minimal camera to go with the minimal data.  This task is to identify the minimal data and find a location for it.
2,Implement designed tests for processCcd,Implement the designed tests with the installed data.
2,Generate use case,We should first sit down with a Camera team rep (Jim C. maybe) to define the tool they need.  How dynamic are the data?  What is the layout of the data?  We should also get some example test data to work with.
2,Sync test data headers with standards,The headers will need to be vetted against known FITS standards.  The headers should be valid and should not contain any non-standard keywords.  There should also be a census of FITS standards that may be used for defining sensor layout.
2,Verify use of the tool with the camera team,We will need to run the tool in the camera team's system to make sure the interfaces are as they expected.  It will also help to make sure that the tool addresses all of the cases.
2,Design the API,"The API will have to be able to accommodate data we know about, so will need to deal with reasonable missing data.  It should also not preclude extension.  This will need to be RFC'd since it is an API change."

1,SyncTool fails to connect when using a password with special characters,"When a DuraCloud user sets their password to a value which includes special characters they are able to log in to the DuraCloud UI just fine, but attempting to connect using the command line SyncTool results in a stacktrace like the following:    Starting"
1,Add REST API call to retrieve latest fixity report for a given space,"As discussed in DPS-123, Jim Tuttle from Duke needs a way to easily retrieve bit integrity reports generated by the DuraCloud Mill. This task is to add a new REST API call to the DuraStore API which will allow for retrieving the latest report file."
2,Remove integration-test and unit-test-db modules,"The tests in the integration-test module have been disabled since 4/25/2011. The most important of these, the tests for storage provider connections, have been recreated in the ""integration"" module. Many of the remaining tests are likely far out of date. "
2,Finish storage report conversion:  relative space byte and item count sizes.,For beanstalk version implement storage stats pie chart view of space size and space item count as of x day to match what is currently available in duracloud 3.6.0.
1,Remove dashboard from duradmin,No longer supported.
1,Bit Integrity Report REST call incorrectly returns 204 code when space is not found.,It should be returning 404
1,OpenstackProvider marker and prefix params are not url encoded on space listing calls,This problem applies to both get spaces and get spaces chunked calls.  It appears that this problem was addresses for get content calls.  So the OpenStackStorageProvider performs a url encode as well as some other encoding magic to get things to work prop
1,Durastore:  TaskProviderFactory is not aware of global account repo,"With the recent beanstalk-oriented changes, any durastore instance can serve requests for any account.    However it appears that the TaskProviderFactoryImpl is not aware of these changes.  It is still thinking that it must be initialized externally as op"
2,Remove classic init from DuraCloud,"As we move towards an Elastic Beanstalk oriented deployment,  we no longer need to support classic two phase init (ie xml posted to the application)."
1,Duradmin must be aware of AccountChangeEvents,
1,Mill:  Handle corner case of missing storage provider,Currently the looping task producers  will enter an infinite loop if a storage provider is missing.  It should retry a few times.  If it continues to fail it should send and an email and move on.
2,Ensure DuraCloud dependencies are version consistent and secure,This task is to add two new checks to the DuraCloud dependency chain:  1. Add the dependency convergence option to the maven enforcer (https://maven.apache.org/enforcer/enforcer-rules/dependencyConvergence.html). This compares versions in the dependency t
1,Changes to users in management console does not always trigger update in duracloud,The following scenarios appear not to cause a cache update in duracloud:    1. Removing a user from an account  2. Adding a new user to an account  3. Updating a user's rights on an account.    also: double check deleting a user from all accounts works.
1,Setup Bit integrity producer to run automatically,"It would be beneficial to rerun failed bit integrity runs in order to reduce the time spent managing bit integrity failures.     To achieve this end we must  1. Ensure that if an instance of the producer is currently running, do not run.  2.  modify the b"
1,Looping task producers should ignore Inactive Accounts,Currently inactive accounts are not ignored.  
1,500 error attempting to download file through DurAdmin,"In the UNC account, the file named 20304_VT0010_0001.mp4 in the space sfc20304-open cannot be downloaded using the ""Download"" button. Selecting the download button results in a 500 error, which is captured in the attached ""500-error-trace.txt"" file. The e"
1,Duplicate response headers from REST API,"Calling the REST API for GetContentProperties return some duplicate headers, excerpted below:    $ curl -I -u ""${DURACLOUD_USER}:${DURACLOUD_PASSWORD}"" https://${DURACLOUD_HOST}/durastore/rest-api-testing/foo2    HTTP/1.1 200 OK  Date: Tue, 05 Apr 2016 19"
2,Beanstalk:  ACLStorageProvider must be reloaded on ACL change,ACLs are currently cached in the ACLStorageProvider in order to improve performance of space reads.  This works fine when a single instance of ACLStorageProvider can be assumed.  However in beanstalk mode we expect that each node may have a copy of the sa
1,Do a test run of 4.0.0-SNAPSHOT on beanstalk.,
1,Create dev AMI for  DuraCloud 4.x testing.,
1,Improve indexing of management console database,
1,Beanstalk: Load duracloud properties from S3,Currently -Dduracloud.config.file only supports files.  In order to make it possible for us to use a plain vanilla beanstalk ami it would be better for us to load config from S3.     Loading from S3 would make the instances more secure by now storing cred
1,root URI does not  redirect to /duradmin/ in 4.0.0 on beanstalk,https://<account>.duracloud.org does not redirect to  https://<account>.duracloud.org/duradmin as it does in the current production 3.x line.
1,Remove duracloud user and password from GlobalProperties in Management Console,
1,MC:  global properties form does not give useful feedback when data is invalid,
2,Investigate automate deployment to beanstalk,"As a first step, it would be very helpful if commits to development version were automatically deployed to a test beanstalk environment.  Additionally it would be good if integration tests were run as part of that process.    NB: Since dependencies such a"
1,Make MC able to read properties from S3,
1,upgrade spring security in management console,
1,upgrade spring security in snapshot,
1,Non-admin users not able to see snapshots,"On a DuraCloud Vault instance (vault.d.o), I gave read/write permissions to two spaces to a non-admin user. Both of those spaces had snapshots (one complete, one in process). When logged in as the user, both spaces were visible, but no snapshots were disp"
1,Add restful error handling to the Storage Report REST API,Currently failures are returning 500 errors.
1,Refactor storage report API endpoints to be more consistent with the rest of the DuraCloud API,"Current API endpoints:    # Provides a listing of totals for content in a space over a time range  /storagestats/timeseries ? spaceID & storeID & start & end    # For a single day, provides a list of report details for each space in a store  /storagestats"
1,SyncTool chunking error,I have an issue chunking files larger than the max size:     ERROR 2016/05/07 02:46:37 [pool-3-thread-2] (SyncWorker.java:68) [run()] - Exception syncing file /srv/perkins/duracloud/spaces/repository.duke.edu-dev/BINARIES/d4/a6/22/d4a622b5a2a64e750e3e01ab
1,Management Console: Deleting a user from an account is failing,HTTP Status 403 - Invalid CSRF Token 'null' was found on the request parameter '_csrf' or header 'X-CSRF-TOKEN'.    Probably is due to the fact that  CSRF tokens are on by default in the new spring security.
1,Management console: Logout link results in 404,
1,Move Bit Integrity Producer on to the Sentinel,In order to better utilize our AWS resources we should do the following:      1. Retire the Bit Integrity Producer  Autoscale group and configuration.  2. Move the bit integrity producer process onto the sentinel and have it run continuously.  3. Upgrade 
1,Mill: Dup Task Processor should perform delete on destination only if the source does not contain item.,In order to cover the case of content disappearing (due to provider failure) from the source provider we must make sure to delete destination store content only if the content is no longer in the source manifest.  Currently if a dup task comes to dup cont

2,Add Chronopolis storage provider,"This will be a subclass of the snapshot provider, to provide the ability to push to Chronopolis, not DPN."
1,"Update Bridge dependencies to rely on latest duracloud,spring, etc.","Update dependencies for duracloud, spring, hibernate, etc.  Resolve any issues the upgrade creates."
1,Chart data calls are returning 500 error from DuraStore,
1,Add CORS headers to Elastic Beanstalk config,We need to perform the same config on 4.x that we did on 3.x 
1,Use Manifest to Count items and Bytes for Glacier for Storage Stats,
1,Error message on Chronopolis provider says DPN,"If a communication or other error occurs within the Chronopolis provider, an error dialog is shown that includes the text: ""DuraCloud is not currently able to connect to DPN"".     This error continues to make sense for the DPN provider, but not for the Ch"
1,Tags for USER role with read-only permission are presented with no spaces,"When a user with USER role is given read access to a space, they are able to see the content, but when they select the content in the UI, the list of tags are listed with no space between the tags, so they all appear as if they are a single word.    Examp"
2,Update Duplication Monitor to work with DuraCloud 4.x,1. Remove obsolete dependencies on database  2. Retrieve space counts from storage stats rather than making a content item count by means of looping through all the content ids.  3. Ensure monitor username and password is encrypted  
1,Ensure that management console uses beanstalk settings to require https,It should work just like the duracloud elastic beanstalk.
1,"Management Console:  Changing a root user's profile (password, etc) does not reset all caches ",Resetting a root user's profile should reset all user data caches.   Currently a USERS_CHANGED message is being sent with no accountId.  The result is that instances are not registering the change.
